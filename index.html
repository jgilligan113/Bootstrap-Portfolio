				<br><p>Jessie Gilligan is a southern girl with a tech twist.  She was born in Juliette, GA (home of the film, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101921/" alt="Fried Green Tomatoes Movie">Fried Green Tomatoes</a>) and raised on a dirt road, riding horses and four-wheelers. Graduating from a small university in Savannah, GA obtained a bachelors degree in chemistry minoring in physical science.  This is also where she met her Savannah-native husband and love of her life, Colin.
				</p>
				<p>
				After realizing chemistry wasn't enough, she went into operations management and again, this played into some skills, but wasn't quite it.  When she started working for the best-in-class art and design college in Savannah, she found it.  Design, analytics, innovation, process analysis - this is where she would bloom.  Her family is growing and a solid foundation for her. She loves that time together, contributing to her family financially and feeling a sense of doing what she loves makes this career the one that feels less like work and more like life.
				</p>
				<p>
				Jessie has been working as a systems analyst building on Salesforce's Force.com platform working through application administration, learning apex code, and is obtaining her full-stack web development certification from the prestigious Georgia Institute of Technology School of Professional Education (completion July 2017). With her unique background in process analysis, her attention to detail and her unique design sense, she is a solid web developer and is one to watch for.
				</p>
				<p>
				When she is not developing or working, she is running, biking, climbing mountains, camping and enjoying her family.  She also enjoys going to her parents lodge in Midway, GA to shoot sporting clays and get back to her southern roots cooking with her mom and spending time with her husband and daughter in the country.
